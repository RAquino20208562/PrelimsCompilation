She left him with a broken heart

He walks alone, confused.

Lost without her by his side

He softly sings the blues. </i>

In the darkened stormy night

He sings his solemn tune.

Tears roll from his reddened eyes

As he strums, and drums, and croons. </u>

The joyful music he once had sang

Only causes him to weep.

And how he set her free. </b> </i>

Her arms were once his home. </u> </i>

So he strolls down an empty street

In search of a reason to hold on.

She is now his only muse,

And her memory is his song. </b> </i>
