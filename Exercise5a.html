Abstract <br>
The paper goes over what would happen when deep learning methods are implemented for University Network Traffic. In order to predict the outcome, the paper will compare the network before the implementation of deep learning and after the implementation of deep learning. If the results show an increase in data transfer speed after the implementation of deep learning, it suggests that the implementation of deep learning in any network system will most likely improve the data transfer speed. The paper first defines what deep learning is. It then utilizes different methods of deep learning in order to train the system. The system will go through the training phase, testing phase, and the prediction phase in order to familiarize it with the current network system. Once it understands the network system, it will find the optimized network system in order to improve the speed of network connection.

  <dt><b>Deep Learning</b></dt>
  <dd>- Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.</dd>
  <dt><b>Networks</b></dt>
  <dd>- A network, in computing, is a group of two or more devices or nodes that can communicate. Networks may be used for: Communications such as email, instant messaging, chat rooms, etc.</dd>
  <dt><b>Implemention</b></dt>
  <dd>- The process of putting a decision or plan into effect; execution.</dd>
  <dt><b>Data Transfer</b></dt>
  <dd>- Data transfer or transfer is any information that is transferred from one location to another through some communication method.</dd>
  <dt><b>Methods</b></dt>
  <dd>- A particular form of procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.</dd>
  <dt><b>System</b></dt>
  <dd>- A system is an organized collection of parts (or subsystems) that are highly integrated to accomplish an overall goal. The system has various inputs, which go through certain processes to produce certain outputs, which together, accomplish the overall desired goal for the system.</dd>
  <dt><b>Training Phase</b></dt>
  <dd>- A microcycle is the individual weeks that make up a macrocycle. The simplest way to split up your year of training is through 3 phases (or macrocycles): preparatory, competitive, and transition. Typically during a preparatory phase you work on general strength and conditioning exercises that are not sport specific.</dd>
  <dt><b>Testing Phase</b></dt>
  <dd>- The primary purpose of the Test Phase is to determine whether the automated system/application software or other IT solution developed or acquired and preliminarily tested during the Development Phase is ready for implementation.</dd>
  <dt><b>Familiarize</b></dt>
  <dd>- ive (someone) knowledge or understanding of something.</dd>
  <dt><b>Network Connection</b></dt>
  <dd>- Computer networks connect nodes like computers, routers, and switches using cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals. These connections allow devices in a network to communicate and share information and resources. Networks follow protocols, which define how communications are sent and received.</dd>
